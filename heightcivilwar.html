        <p class="hometitle">HEIGHT OF THE CIVIL WAR</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hometext">It is difficult to put a pin on the time period during the civil war which would be the most chaotic, but what can be talked about is all of the factions that rose up amidst all the chaos. Some of these factions include:</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hometext"><b><u>Makhnovschina</u></b></p>
        <p class="hometext">The Makhnovschina was an anarcho-communist territory in southeast Ukraine, named after and led by Nestor Makhno, a Ukrainian anarchist revolutionary. They rose up as part of a resistance against the Central Powers occupation of Ukraine with the Ukrainian People's Republic, and allied with the Bolsheviks. However, after the Germans and Whites were ran out of Ukraine, the Bolsheviks turned on the anarchists, betraying them and destroying their movement, resulting in Makhno fleeing to Paris with the support of French anarchist groups (this was considered very controversial, especially among Ukrainian anarchists).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hometext"><b><u>Bogd Khanate of Mongolia</u></b></p>
        <p class="hometext">Before the civil war, Mongolia fell out of Russian influence due to the mass instability. However, in an effort to restore Russian influence, Russian troops, Red and White, invaded Mongolia. One of these efforts was led by Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, an ally of the White Army, who invaded Mongolia in an effort to drive out the Chinese, and restore Mongolian independence so he could lead the nation. His imperial ambitions were inspired by Genghis Khan. He is literally considered by many to be insane, and it is no surprise he eventually lost when Soviet troops came and took him.</p>
